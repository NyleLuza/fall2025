1. Show that the greedy approach always finds an optimal solution for the
Change problem when the coins are in the denominations D0, D1, D2, â€¦ , Di
for some integers i > 0 and D > 0.

The greedy approach finds the most optimal problem because the denominator
makes sure that the ratio is still consistent because if a coin were to be
an outlier with a random value, it would make the alg not optimal

4. *Seperate file*

5. Implement Prim's algorithm (Algorithm 4.1) on your system, and study its
performance using different graphs.
